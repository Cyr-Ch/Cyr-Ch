# 👋 Hi, I'm Cyrine

🎓 **AI Researcher & Founder** working at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Decision Intelligence**, and **Energy Systems**.  
My research aims to **leverage foundation models for solving complex decision-making tasks** through **specialization**, **reinforcement learning**, and **adaptive optimization**. I’m broadly interested in **probabilistic inference**, **online learning**, and **optimization under uncertainty**.  

Currently building **intelligent optimization models for microgrids and energy trading**, and developing **foundational decision models** for dynamic, real-world environments.


🌍 Actively collaborating with the **Young AI Leaders program** under the **United Nations ITU’s AI for Good initiative**, leading projects that apply AI for **climate action**, **sustainability**, and **positive societal impact**.
